# Building-Your-DeFi-Empire

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdoms Clone Development Guide. This guide is intended to provide an overview of setting up a custom EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet on the Avalanche network and deploying the fundamental components of your DeFi Kingdoms clone. Given the complexity of DeFi Kingdoms, this guide will focus on the essential steps related to custom subnet development.

## Introduction

DeFi Kingdoms is a highly complex decentralized finance application. This guide will cover the fundamentals needed to set up a custom subnet and deploy basic game components. For a comprehensive understanding of DeFi Kingdoms, further exploration and learning will be necessary.

## Setting Up Your EVM Subnet

To create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, follow these steps:

1. Refer to our [guide](link-to-guide) and the [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/) for detailed instructions.
2. Install the required tools and dependencies.
3. Configure your subnet settings according to your project's requirements.
4. Launch your subnet and ensure it is operational.

## Defining Your Native Currency

Setting up your native currency involves:

1. Defining the tokenomics of your in-game currency.
2. Using Solidity to create and deploy the native currency token contract.
3. Ensuring your token contract aligns with the ERC-20 standard for compatibility and functionality.

## Connecting to MetaMask

To connect your EVM subnet to MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask and navigate to the network settings.
2. Add a new network with the parameters specific to your custom subnet (RPC URL, Chain ID, etc.).
3. Follow the detailed steps in our [guide](link-to-guide) to complete the connection process.

## Deploying Basic Building Blocks

Deploy the basic building blocks of your game using Solidity and Remix:

1. **Smart Contracts for Game Mechanics**: Develop contracts for key game functions like battling, exploring, and trading.
2. **Liquidity Pools**: Set up pools to manage the in-game economy.
3. **Tokens**: Create and manage in-game tokens that players will use for various activities.
4. **Deployment**: Use Remix IDE to write, compile, and deploy your smart contracts to your EVM subnet.
